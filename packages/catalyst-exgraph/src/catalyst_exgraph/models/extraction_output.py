"""Canonical LLM output models for structured extraction.

These models define the exact schema that LLMs must emit when using
``with_structured_output()``.  Field names match what the validators expect
(``text``, ``mention_type``, ``span_start``, ``span_end``), eliminating the
field-name mismatch that occurs with free-form prompting.

The Pydantic class name, docstring, and Field descriptions are all injected
into the tool/function schema the LLM sees, so they serve as both documentation
and prompt engineering.
